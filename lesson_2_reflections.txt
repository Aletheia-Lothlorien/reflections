When I initialize a git repository, it doesn't create any commits. I will have untracked files,
if there were any files in the directory already, and I must decide whether to add them to the
staging area and commit them.

The staging area serves as a bridge between my working directory and the repository.
Everything is stored in my working directory, so I take them out and lay them bare so that I can
assess what goes where. Once I've decided what to add and what to remove, then I can commit them
to the repository. The staging area is workspace and a buffer.
